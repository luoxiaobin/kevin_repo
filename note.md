Microservice
DevOps, CICD, automated testing, ...
Containerization

team setting
- focus and coverage
- tech roadmap
- leverage (DRY principle)
- design pattern
- development practice (pair programming, proper pull request, code review...)
- definition of done

agility of the team

containerization
- quicker delivery
- repeatable
- consistent 

12 factor application -> cloud native

API based design, API gateway, circuit breaker ...

traditional monolithic application has so many dependencies while microservices architecture has much less and can offer a lot more in agility

Spring Cloud vs Spring Boot (Spring Boot seems to be the way to actually implement microservices where Spring Cloud looks at it at a higher level, including deployment, setup, operationalization, support, service management etc.)

Service Mesh - lstio

testing
testing against API (interface) - based on API contract, services much more testable 

Microservices architecture requires developer to understand business (insight) such that it can put the right design in the right place

key word
- Spring Cloud Data Flow
